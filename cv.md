About myself I can say that I just started studying programming at RS-School. I am 30 years old and I work as an electrician at the "[plant for the production of uranium tantalum and beryllium](http://www.ulba.kz)". This work is wonderful, but I don't want to stand in one place. Since I have been fond of computers and information technology for a long time, I decided to study the profession of a web developer.  
 * I believe that I am:
   1. purposeful 
   2. responsible,
   3. stress-resistant
